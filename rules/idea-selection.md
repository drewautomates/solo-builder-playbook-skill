# Idea Selection: Pick Proven, Not Novel

**Core principle**: 17 of 19 successful founders built in an existing category. Nobody invented a new market. They found proven demand and executed better.

## The Rules

### 1. Never build something that doesn't already exist

> "Pick an idea that's been done before. New ideas are risky. If you pick an idea that's been done before, you know that people want it."
> -- Mike, $200K MRR across 5 SaaS apps

> "I found a successful app, made it 1% different, and now make $12K/month"
> -- David Attias, Stoppr

### 2. Apply domain knowledge

Every successful founder built in a space they deeply understood:
- Hassam knew Amazon selling → built Amazon research tool ($25K MRR)
- George was a wrestler → built AI wrestling coach ($17K MRR)
- Louis studied makeup TikTok for months → built makeup AI app ($800K/year)
- Bhanu built SaaS tools → built SiteGPT for SaaS support ($13K MRR)

> "If you can spend 1,000 hours on a project and implement your domain knowledge, you're going to be successful."
> -- Hassam, $25K MRR in 90 days

### 3. The four-filter test (Samuel's framework)

Before building, every idea must pass:
1. **Will I use it myself?**
2. **Can I see it already works?** (look for founders sharing Stripe screenshots on Twitter)
3. **They're NOT spending thousands on marketing** (true organic demand, not manufactured)
4. **Simple enough to maintain** as a solo dev or tiny team

### 4. Validate through communities, not surveys

| Method | Who Used It | How |
|--------|------------|-----|
| TikTok comment mining | Louis (GlowUp) | Read thousands of comments to find pain points people literally type out |
| Discord chat history | Sam (Algrow) | Copy-pasted days of chat into ChatGPT: "List all pain points discussed" |
| Reddit threads | Roman (Goji Berry) | Searched for recurring questions in target subreddits |
| Competitor reviews | Nic (BlogToPin) | Read every G2/AppSumo/Capterra review for competitors |
| Ahrefs traffic analysis | Samuel | Check if competitors have organic + paid traffic (strong demand signal) |

### 5. The contrarian takes worth considering

> "We will never go after an AI focused business. Too many times you have an idea that relies on an API that you do not control, which puts you at massive risk."
> -- Mike, $200K MRR

> "You don't have to love the idea. Makeup is not my passion. It's my capitalistic endeavor."
> -- Louis, $800K/year from a makeup app

> "Distribution doesn't matter if you don't have a viral idea in nature."
> -- George, $17K MRR (pushes back on "distribution > product")

## Decision Framework

```
START HERE:
├── Do you have domain knowledge in a specific area?
│   ├── YES → Find existing tools in that space with bad UX or gaps
│   │         → Build something better for ONE specific use case
│   └── NO  → Go to TikTok/Reddit/Discord in areas you're curious about
│            → Spend 2 weeks reading comments for recurring pain points
│            → Pick the niche where pain is loudest and solutions are weakest
│
├── Does the idea already have paying customers somewhere?
│   ├── YES → Good. Proceed. Don't reinvent.
│   └── NO  → Risky. Consider a different idea.
│
└── Can you explain the value in 5 seconds? (George's "gotcha moment")
    ├── YES → Build it.
    └── NO  → Simplify until you can.
```
