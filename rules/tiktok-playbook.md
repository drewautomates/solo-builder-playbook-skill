# TikTok-First App Playbook

## The Core Insight

> "Instead of just building another app, I studied TikTok."
> -- Louis, GlowUp

Louis validated his idea, built his audience, and drove all revenue through TikTok. Content came FIRST. The app came AFTER viral validation.

## Phase 1: Market Research (7 days, zero posting)

From Steven's framework:
1. Search TikTok for keywords in your niche
2. Filter by most liked videos of all time
3. For each viral video, document in a spreadsheet:
   - The hook (first 1-3 seconds)
   - The storyline
   - The call to action
   - Visual details (camera angles, settings, movements)
4. Scroll and study for 7 days before posting anything

From Louis's approach:
1. Read TikTok COMMENTS, not just videos
2. Look for pain points people literally type out
3. Check hashtag volume -- bigger hashtags = bigger market
4. If people are ASKING for a solution in comments, you've found your idea

## Phase 2: Account Setup & Warmup

### Account Creation
1. Use a USA phone with USA SIM card (if outside US, buy USA SIM + VPN)
2. Download TikTok, create account
3. Do NOT post anything for 3 days
4. Instead: scroll, like, comment in your niche for 15-30 minutes/day
5. This tells the algorithm you're a real person, not a bot

### Creating Content Before Building
1. Start posting about the PROBLEM your app will solve
2. One post per day initially
3. You don't need an app yet -- just content about the pain point
4. If content goes viral → validated idea → build the app
5. If content gets no traction → pivot to different angle or niche

> "We did content first because for most of my other apps before we were just building and building without showing to users what we had and it always failed."
> -- Louis

## Phase 3: Content Scaling

### When You See Traction
1. Scale from 1 post/day to 4-6 posts/day
2. Find trends that are easy to reproduce and faceless (if you can't do video yourself)
3. When a video pops off, recreate that CONCEPT repeatedly (not the exact same video)
4. Post on ALL platforms simultaneously (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts)

### Louis's Scale System (at peak)
- 7 accounts posting 8-12 times daily
- 2-3 accounts per phone
- Buy additional phones for more accounts
- Each account warms up separately

### Steven's Content Formula
- **Hook** → **Problem** → **Solution/CTA**
- "Volume negates luck" -- post as much as possible
- Don't be a perfectionist, focus on direction
- Pin highest-converting videos to your profile

## Phase 4: Conversion Mechanics

### Anchor Links (Direct Download Buttons)
- TikTok allows anchor links on videos -- a "Download Now" button
- Add anchor link when video hits ~500K+ views
- Do NOT add to videos under 1K views -- kills the video's reach
- Most downloads come through anchor links, not bio links

### Referral Loops
Louis's referral system that went mega-viral:
1. In-app: "Invite 3 friends = free makeup look"
2. Users see viral video → download app → see referral offer
3. Users return to the viral video's comments to share their referral code
4. This re-engagement BOOSTS the video's algorithm ranking
5. More engagement → more views → more downloads → cycle repeats

**One video**: 48 million views, 2 million likes, 60K downloads, $12.5K in sales in ONE DAY.

### The "Three-Word" Test (Pushscroll Team)
Your app needs:
1. One visually heavy element (works in a 5-second video)
2. Must be explainable in 3 words
3. Must solve a fundamental human desire

## Phase 5: Paid Scaling (After Organic PMF)

From Steven's framework:
1. Install MMP (Adjust or AppsFlyer) to feed data to ad platforms
2. Upload best-performing organic videos as paid ads
3. Start optimizing for top-of-funnel (views), then clicks, then installs, then trials
4. Target **3:1 CAC to LTV ratio** = "money printing machine"
5. Focus on one platform first (TikTok or Meta)

Steven's numbers:
- Spent $82K total on paid ads
- Scaled from $3K to $44K MRR with paid ads
- Cost per click: 3 cents to 35 cents
- CAC: $20-24, LTV: $55-70+

## Common Mistakes

- Building the app before validating with content (biggest mistake)
- Adding anchor links to low-view videos (kills reach)
- Using only one account (limits volume)
- Ignoring comments section (that's where the market research is)
- Posting inconsistently (algorithm rewards daily posting)

## Timeline Expectations

- Week 1: Market research + account warmup
- Week 2-4: Daily posting, finding what resonates
- Month 2: Scale to multiple accounts if seeing traction
- Month 3-4: If content is viral, build and launch MVP
- Month 4-6: $10K+ MRR if product converts
