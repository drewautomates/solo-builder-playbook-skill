# Lifetime Deal (LTD) Strategy

**Source**: Mike ($200K MRR across 5 SaaS apps)

## Why LTDs

LTDs are NOT a business model. They are a **bootstrapping capital strategy**.

The goal: raise $50-100K+ in cash to fund content production and survive until MRR kicks in.

## The Three-Phase LTD Plan

### Phase 1: Private LTD (~$30K)
- Price: $59-100 one-time payment
- Where: Reddit groups, Facebook groups, X/Twitter, LTD communities
- Do as much work as possible to sell privately
- Frill (one of Mike's apps) raised ~$30K from private LTD alone

### Phase 2: AppSumo Launch (~$50-70K)
- AppSumo has massive reach and a huge buyer database
- Two options: marketplace listing (lower fee) or select program (sales team help)
- Gets you hundreds of users fast + significant capital

### Phase 3: Final "Closing Forever" LTD (~$20-30K)
- FOMO pricing: "This is the last time this deal will ever be available"
- Bump prices slightly from Phase 1
- Send to your mailing list
- Close it permanently -- never offer LTD again

**Combined goal: $100K+ in runway**

## The Review Army (Phase 2.5)

This is the hidden genius of the LTD strategy:

After your LTD phase, ask LTD customers to write reviews on:
- TrustPilot
- G2
- Capterra
- Google

> "LTD community are willing to do that because they really, really want you to succeed. They're your early ambassadors."
> -- Mike

LTD users are inherently invested -- they've paid forever, so they want the product to thrive. They'll:
- Write detailed reviews
- Report bugs thoroughly
- Give honest feedback
- Evangelize to others

## Transitioning to MRR

After closing your final LTD:
1. Switch to monthly/annual subscription pricing
2. Never offer LTD again (scarcity was real)
3. Use LTD capital to write content (comparison pages, blog posts, SEO)
4. Reviews from LTD users drive trust and organic signups
5. Goal: MRR replaces LTD capital before runway ends (12-24 months)

## When to Use LTDs

- Early stage SaaS (pre-$5K MRR)
- You need capital for content/marketing but don't want VC
- Your product is good enough for daily use but needs more features
- You want a feedback army of invested users

## When NOT to Use LTDs

- Your product isn't stable enough for paying users
- You're already profitable on MRR
- Your unit economics don't support one-time payments
- Mobile apps (LTDs work better for SaaS)
