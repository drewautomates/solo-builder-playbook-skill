# Pricing & Revenue Strategy

## Pricing Models That Work

| Model | Price Range | Best For | Example |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Monthly SaaS | $25-99/month | B2B tools | Tibo (Outrank $99/mo), Sam (Algrow $25-80/mo) |
| Weekly subscription | $9.99/week | High-engagement mobile B2C | Louis (GlowUp) |
| Annual + monthly | $9.99/mo or $39-59/yr | Mobile apps | George (Wrestle AI), Steven (PuffCount) |
| Tiered (3 plans) | $29-199/month | B2B with clear value tiers | Roman (Goji Berry), Rob (SuperX $29/mo) |
| Lifetime Deal → MRR | $59-100 LTD, then transition | Bootstrapping phase | Mike ($200K MRR) |
| Freemium → Pro | Free tier + paid | Lead gen / SEO tools | Bhanu (SiteGPT) |

## Pricing Insights

### Attach trial to annual plan
> George: "We attach the trial to the yearly option."
This maximizes LTV per converted user -- they start the trial on the most expensive plan.

### Never give away free accounts (Mike's rule)
> "If people pay for it, they'll use it. That's key. You want people using your product and telling you why it's crap."

Exception: Nevo (Postiz) uses open source free tier as distribution, with paid cloud hosting.

### Hard paywalls vs. freemium
- Hard paywall (Pushscroll, $30/year): Forces immediate conversion decision
- Freemium (SiteGPT, Postiz): Lower conversion but wider reach
- Choose based on whether you need USERS (freemium) or REVENUE (hard paywall)

## Revenue Milestones (Realistic)

| Milestone | Typical Timeline | What Unlocks It |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $0 → $1K MRR | 2-8 weeks | First 10-30 paying users from direct outreach |
| $1K → $5K MRR | 1-3 months | One organic channel producing consistent signups |
| $5K → $10K MRR | 2-6 months | Content compounding + word of mouth |
| $10K → $30K MRR | 4-12 months | SEO + scaling winning channel |
| $30K → $100K MRR | 6-24 months | Paid ads + affiliates + team |

## When Something Isn't Converting

From Eyal & Yahli (PropGPT):
- High trial rate (45%) + low trial-to-paid (13%) = **product problem**, not marketing problem
- Stop all marketing spend
- Rebuild based on analytics (track feature clicks, onboarding dropoff)
- Don't throw money at a broken product
