## Step 1: Outreach at Scale

- DM 100 influencers per day
- First words of every DM: **"Paid promo?"** -- influencers skip everything else
- They get hundreds to thousands of DMs daily. Only money gets attention.

## Step 2: Build Credibility

When starting out:
- Bot your personal Instagram with followers (for social proof)
- Pay to verify your account
- Once you have a few deals under your belt, switch to your business account

## Step 3: Get on the Phone

> -- George

- Once they respond to your DM, text your phone number: "Let's hop on a call soon"
- If they try to hard-close via text ("What's your offer?"): "Just hit me up when you're not busy"
- They want your money. You have leverage. Don't rush.

## Step 4: Deal Structure

**The optimal deal**: 20-50% upfront, 4-5 videos, view guarantee based on $2-5 CPM

Example calculation:
- Influencer averages 25,000 views per video
- Offer: $225 for 4 videos with 100K minimum view guarantee
- Pay $50-100 upfront
- If they don't hit 100K views, they keep posting until they do, then get the rest

## Step 5: Scaling

- **Starting out**: Hire a VA for mass DMing ($200-500/month). Volume matters early.
- **Middle phase**: Do it yourself -- your response rate is higher once brand is recognized
- **Scaling**: Once you find influencers who convert well, increase budget and re-book them

George's numbers:
- Invested ~$500 in influencer marketing
- Generated $13K+ in a single month
- Co-founder (major wrestling influencer) provided launch boost

## The Influencer + Viral Content Combo (Eyal & Yahli)

- Their 70th UGC video got 600K views
- That ONE video raised their ARR from $8K to $38K in 3 days
- Lesson: Volume matters. Most videos won't hit. But the one that does changes everything.

- Your niche has active influencers (fitness, gaming, beauty, sports, finance)
- You have $500+/month budget
- Your product has a "gotcha moment" that looks good in a short video
- Organic content has proven the concept works

## When NOT to Use

- B2B SaaS with no visual demo
- Your product requires explanation longer than 30 seconds
- You have $0 budget (use Reddit/Discord instead)
