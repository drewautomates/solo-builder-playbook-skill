# Discord Community Playbook

**Source**: Sam, university student, zero coding background. Built Algrow to $14K MRR and 10,000 users in 6 months using Discord.

## Why Discord

- Untapped channel most founders ignore
- Real-time conversations reveal pain points better than any survey
- Younger audiences (18-30) check Discord more than email
- Community owners can become organic advocates
- Zero cost

> "Discord is 10 times better than email for building relationships with users."
> -- Sam, $14K MRR

## Step 1: Find Where Your ICP Lives

1. Go to **discboard.org**
2. Type keywords related to your niche
3. Join every relevant Discord community (aim for 5-10 servers)
4. Look for servers with 500+ active members

## Step 2: Listen Before You Build

1. Scroll through chat history -- days and days of it
2. Copy-paste chat history into ChatGPT: "List all pain points these people discussed"
3. Look for **recurring** pain points -- repetition = demand
4. Use the search bar in Discord to find specific keywords people are asking about

> "I went to the search bar and typed 'niches.' The major result was people searching 'how do I find a niche.' When I saw people repeating this, I was like, that is the demand."
> -- Sam

## Step 3: Validate Through Presence, Not Pitching

**The screen-share trick** (Sam's breakthrough):
1. Join a Discord voice chat
2. Mute your mic
3. Share your screen showing you using your tool
4. People see it and ask: "Sam, what are you using? What is this?"
5. You respond: "Oh, it's a tool I built."

This is NOT self-promotion. You're just... using your tool in public. People come to YOU.

> "I did this for about a week straight. It even attracted the eyes of the Discord server owner to the point that he created a YouTube long-form promotional video on the tool. I didn't ask him. I didn't pay for it."
> -- Sam

## Step 4: Provide Value First, Always

**Why you won't get banned** (unlike spammers):
- Most Discord servers have "no self-promo" rules
- Instead of posting "check out my tool!", HELP people with their problems using your tool
- "A person would ask for a channel recommendation. I would use my tool to find it for them."
- Word of mouth does the rest: "I asked them where they came from. They'd say, 'My friend told me.'"

## Step 5: Build Your Own Server

Once you have initial traction:
1. Create your own Discord server for your product
2. Funnel interested users from other communities → your server
3. This gives you a direct line to your users
4. Use it instead of email for early customer support and feedback
5. Build the product WITH your community, not just FOR them

## Step 6: Convert with a Waitlist

1. Once you have interested people, create a simple waitlist
2. Share the waitlist link in Discord communities where you've built rapport
3. "If you want to try the tool, sign up here. We'll email you when it's ready."
4. Give all early waitlist users free access -- they become your advocates
5. Their friends will have to pay, but early users can demo it for them

## Common Mistakes

- Joining a server and immediately posting "check out my tool!" (instant ban)
- Not spending time building rapport first (2+ weeks of genuine participation)
- Treating Discord like a one-way marketing channel (it's a relationship channel)
- Only joining one community (cast a wider net across 5-10 servers)

## Timeline Expectations

- Week 1-2: Join communities, read chat history, identify pain points
- Week 3-4: Start helping people, screen sharing, building rapport
- Month 2: Create waitlist, share with warm contacts
- Month 3-4: Launch product, convert Discord users
- Month 4-6: Scale word of mouth, build your own server
