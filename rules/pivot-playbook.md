# When to Pivot

**Sources**: Eyal & Yahli (PropGPT, stuck at $2K → rebuilt to $30K MRR), George (failed app at 15, succeeded at 18), Louis (10 failed apps before GlowUp)

## The Signal That Something Is Wrong

### High trials, low conversion = Product problem
Eyal & Yahli had:
- 45% trial conversion rate (good)
- 13% trial-to-paid rate (bad)

This means people were INTERESTED but the product wasn't delivering value. Marketing wasn't the problem.

### High impressions, low downloads = Messaging problem
George's second app "Green":
- 1.8 million impressions
- 100 downloads

Same impressions as Wrestle AI but wildly different results. The idea lacked a "gotcha moment."

### No traction after consistent effort = Wrong channel or wrong idea
Louis built 10 apps that all failed before GlowUp. The difference:
- Failed apps: build first, market after
- GlowUp: content first, validate, THEN build

## The Pivot Playbook (Eyal & Yahli)

1. **Stop all marketing spend** -- don't throw money at a broken product
2. **Obsess over analytics** -- track feature clicks, onboarding dropoff, usage patterns
3. **Find the most compelling value prop** -- what ONE feature do users love?
4. **Simplify radically** -- "Give users the answers, not tools to find answers"
5. **Rebuild around the core value** -- 4 months of rebuilding, zero marketing
6. **Relaunch** -- they hit $30K MRR in 10 weeks after relaunching

> "If product isn't converting, stop marketing and rebuild."

## Tibo's 90% Rule

> "You will have a 90% failure rate. It's the same for me. If you want to take a year and fail 90% of the time, it might take 9 years. If you compress that into weeks, you'll reach success much faster."

The solution isn't avoiding failure. It's failing faster:
- Build MVPs in days/weeks, not months
- Validate through content/communities before building
- Kill projects quickly if they don't show traction in 4-8 weeks
- Move on to the next idea with lessons learned

## When to Persist

Not every slow start means pivot. Persist when:
- Users who DO pay are highly engaged and vocal
- The problem you're solving is real (verified through user conversations)
- Growth is slow but consistent (even $500/month growing 10% month-over-month)
- You haven't tried enough distribution channels yet

## When to Pivot

Pivot when:
- You've tried 3+ distribution channels with no traction
- Users sign up but don't come back (retention problem)
- You can't explain the value in one sentence
- The market has shifted (API dependency, platform changes)
- You're not passionate enough to persist through the hard parts

## The Portfolio Approach (Risk Mitigation)

Both Tibo and Mike run 5+ products specifically to reduce risk:

> "If OpenAI releases a new feature tomorrow and kills one of our products, it's not going to be the end of the world."
> -- Tibo

Consider: instead of going all-in on one idea, run 2-3 small experiments simultaneously. Double down on the one that shows traction.
