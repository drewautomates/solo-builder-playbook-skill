# Distribution Strategy: The #1 Thing That Matters

**The single biggest finding from 19 founder interviews**: Distribution matters more than product. Every founder who grew fast solved distribution first -- often before writing a line of code.

## How to Choose Your Channel

### Step 1: Where does your customer already hang out?

> "Advertise the way you would love to be advertised to."
> -- Roman, $34K MRR via Reddit

- **Developers/technical users** → Reddit, Hacker News, open source, Discord
- **Business owners/SaaS buyers** → Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Reddit (r/SaaS, r/indiehackers)
- **Young consumers (18-25)** → TikTok, Discord, Instagram
- **Professionals/B2B** → LinkedIn, email, partnerships
- **Creators/influencers** → TikTok, YouTube, Discord

### Step 2: Match your strengths

- **Good writer?** → Reddit, SEO content, Twitter threads
- **Good on camera?** → TikTok, YouTube
- **Good at building relationships?** → Discord, partnerships, influencer deals
- **Good at building tools?** → Free tools/engineering as marketing, open source
- **Have money, not time?** → Influencer marketing, paid ads

### Step 3: Stage-appropriate channels

**$0 → $1K MRR** (validation):
- Reddit posts, Discord communities, direct outreach
- Goal: Get 10 paying users who give you daily feedback

**$1K → $10K MRR** (traction):
- Double down on one organic channel
- Building in public on Twitter/X
- Launch on Product Hunt

**$10K → $50K MRR** (growth):
- Add SEO content as compounding channel
- Test paid ads with best organic content
- Start affiliate program

**$50K → $100K+ MRR** (scale):
- Scale paid ads (if CAC:LTV works)
- Hire for content/SEO
- "Scale what works, kill what doesn't" (Tibo's rule)

## The Two-Channel Rule

> "For each software, growth is pretty much about one or two acquisition channels. Those two channels, I'm going all in on them."
> -- Tibo, $700K/month across 5 products

Most founders find that 80%+ of their growth comes from just 1-2 channels. Try many early, but once you find what works, go ALL in. Don't spread across 5 channels at 20% effort each.
