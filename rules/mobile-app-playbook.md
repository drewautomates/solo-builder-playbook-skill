# The Mobile App Playbook: Content-First to $10K+ MRR

**Sources**: Louis (GlowUp, $800K/year), George (Wrestle AI, $17K MRR), Steven (PuffCount, $1M+ exit), Connor ($20K MRR in 14 days of building)

## The Core Framework

1. Validate through content, not code
2. Build the gotcha moment
3. Optimize onboarding as a revenue lever
4. Scale through volume (content + influencers + ads)

## Step 1: Validate Through Content

See `tiktok-playbook.md` for the full TikTok process. The key principle:

> "Content before code. If content goes viral, build the app. If not, pivot."
> -- derived from Louis's approach

## Step 2: The Gotcha Moment (George's Framework)

Every successful mobile app needs three pillars:
1. **Uniqueness** -- catches eyes in the feed
2. **Helpfulness** -- creates stickiness / recurring use
3. **The gotcha moment** -- something that stops the scroll and conveys value in ~5 seconds

> "What could be something that I could seamlessly integrate into a TikTok that will get someone to stop scrolling?"
> -- George, $17K MRR

### Testing the Gotcha Moment
George launched two apps at the same time:
- Wrestle AI (novel idea, clear gotcha moment) → 2M impressions, strong conversions, $17K MRR
- Green (generic concept, no gotcha moment) → 1.8M impressions, 100 downloads, dead

Same impressions. Wildly different results. The gotcha moment is the difference.

## Step 3: Design Process (Connor's Method)

1. Download 20+ apps in your niche
2. Screenshot every page -- especially onboarding screens
3. Put all screenshots in Figma
4. Pick the best elements from each app
5. Redesign with your aesthetic
6. Drop screenshots into Claude/Cursor to generate code

> "Focus 90% on onboarding. Most users only ever see it."
> -- Connor, $20K MRR

## Step 4: Onboarding = Revenue

George's onboarding formula:
1. **Educate** the user about what the app does
2. **Personalize** with guiding questions (sets up app + guides them to WHY they need it)
3. **Create FOMO** about not having the app
4. **Show the gotcha moment** but gate results behind the paywall

> "The length of the onboarding process also contributes to how many people convert. It adds friction, but it also creates the sunken cost fallacy which causes users to at least get the free trial."
> -- George

### Onboarding Pro Tips
- Study high-converting apps: Opal, Cali, Headspace
- Ask for app store review DURING onboarding (before paywall) -- Louis gets 5-star reviews this way
- Build referral prompts into post-onboarding experience

## Step 5: Pricing for Mobile

| Model | Price | Best For | Example |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| Weekly | $9.99/week | High-engagement B2C | GlowUp (makeup) |
| Monthly | $9.99/month | Moderate engagement | Wrestle AI |
| Annual | $39.99-59.99/year | Retention-focused | PuffCount, Wrestle AI |
| Trial → Annual | Free trial, then annual | Highest LTV | Attach trial to yearly option |

**George's trick**: Attach the free trial to the YEARLY option, not monthly. Higher LTV per converted user.

## Step 6: Distribution Scaling

### Organic Content (Phase 1)
See `tiktok-playbook.md`

### Influencer Marketing (Phase 2)
See `influencer-playbook.md`

### Paid Ads (Phase 3)
Steven's scaling framework:
1. Take your best organic videos and use them as ads
2. Install MMP (Adjust/AppsFlyer) for attribution
3. Start with $500-1K/month budget
4. Optimize: views → clicks → installs → trials → subscriptions
5. Target 3:1 CAC:LTV ratio
6. If it works at $1K/month, scale to $10K-100K/month

## Revenue Timeline (realistic)

| Phase | Timeline | Revenue | Key Activity |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Research + Content | Month 1 | $0 | TikTok research, start posting |
| Validation | Month 2 | $0 | Content gaining traction? |
| MVP Build | Month 2-3 | $0 | Build app in 1-4 weeks |
| Launch | Month 3 | $1-5K | Organic content + first users |
| Scale | Month 4-6 | $5-20K MRR | Multiple accounts, influencers |
| Paid Ads | Month 6+ | $20K+ MRR | Scale what works |

## Profit Margins

Mobile apps typically have excellent margins:
- Louis (GlowUp): ~90% profit margin
- George (Wrestle AI): Infrastructure costs ~$100-200/month on $17K revenue
- Main costs: AI inference ($40-100/month), hosting ($30-100/month), marketing (variable)
