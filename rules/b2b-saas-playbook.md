# The B2B SaaS Playbook: Idea to $100K+ MRR

**Sources**: Mike ($200K MRR across 5 SaaS apps, Australia), Tibo ($700K/month across 5 products, France)

This combines the two most detailed, proven playbooks from the dataset. Both founders have repeated their frameworks multiple times with consistent success.

## Mike's 10-Step Playbook

### Step 1: Pick a proven idea
- Something that exists but has bad UX or gaps
- Never build something novel -- "new ideas are risky"
- Check if competitors are doing well DESPITE bad design

### Step 2: Define good-enough MVP
- Study competitor feature sets
- Identify what customers want MOST (not everything)
- Build the minimum that solves the core problem

### Step 3: Launch a private Lifetime Deal (LTD)
- Offer your product for $59-100 one-time payment
- Target Reddit groups, Facebook groups, LTD communities
- Goal: raise ~$30K from private LTD

### Step 4: Never give away free accounts
> "If people pay for it, they'll use it. That's key. You want people using your product. You want people telling you why it's crap."

### Step 5: Hustle the private LTD
- Work Reddit groups, Facebook groups, Twitter/X
- Find LTD communities (there are many)
- Frill raised ~$30K from their private LTD alone

### Step 6: Start writing content IMMEDIATELY
> "It is never, ever, ever, ever too early to start writing content."
- Landing pages, blog posts, competitor comparisons
- "Alternative to [Competitor]" pages
- The longer content is live, the longer Google + AI search indexes it

### Step 7: Launch on AppSumo
- Massive existing audience of buyers
- Two options: marketplace (lower fee) or select (sales team help)
- Goal: close your LTD phase with $100K+ in the bank

### Step 8: One last private LTD
- FOMO pricing -- "closing forever, never available again"
- Bump prices slightly from the first LTD
- Send to your mailing list, then close permanently

### Step 9: Get honest reviews (CRITICAL)
- Ask LTD customers to write reviews on TrustPilot, G2, Capterra
- LTD community WANTS you to succeed -- they're invested
- Reviews boost domain ranking and credibility
- Also answer questions on Reddit about your product category

### Step 10: Survive until MRR replaces LTD runway
- You now have $100K+ and a review army
- Content from Step 6 is compounding via SEO
- Transition to monthly/annual pricing
- The runway buys you 1-2 years to build organic growth

## Tibo's 12-Step Playbook

### Steps 1-4: Build & Validate
1. **Build MVP in days/weeks** -- use no-code, boilerplates, AI tools. "90% failure rate. Compress the timeline."
2. **Find 5-10 relevant people** -- not your mom, not random friends. Your actual target customer.
3. **Build real relationships** -- understand their workflows, their true pain
4. **Talk to them every single day** -- route support to Twitter DMs

### Steps 5-8: Retention Before Acquisition
5. **Understand their ultimate goal** -- how far can you go helping them?
6. **Fix THEIR problems, not yours** -- be a user of your own product daily
7. **Iterate relentlessly** -- ship features users ask for within hours if possible
8. **Repeat until they can't live without it** -- don't go broad until retention is proven

> "If you go broad with low retention, you spend all your energy pushing people to your software and 99% flow away directly after trying."

### Steps 9-12: Distribution & Scale
9. **Go broad** -- try many acquisition channels (Product Hunt, socials, content)
10. **Become a media company** -- content engine: testimonials, case studies, industry takes
11. **Scale sustainably** -- SEO, ads, affiliates. Set up once, scale infinitely.
12. **Kill what doesn't work** -- growth comes from 1-2 channels. Go all in on those.

## Structural Decisions

### Team Structure (Mike's model)
- **4 co-founders**, 25% equity each
- Roles: front-end dev, back-end dev, designer, business/everything else
- Equal split minimizes founder fallout (top reason startups fail)
- No salaries until $10K MRR covers costs
- After $10K MRR: split profits between founders

### Philosophy
> "These businesses are about bigger salaries, not big exits. We stay super super lean so that all the profits come out to the founders."
> -- Mike

### Portfolio vs Single Product
Both Mike and Tibo run 5+ products. Reasoning:

> "If OpenAI releases a new feature tomorrow and kills one of our products -- which by the way happened when Elon Musk took over X and almost killed Tweet Hunter while it was making $200K per month -- it's not going to be the end of the world."
> -- Tibo

### Risk Mitigation
- Don't build on APIs you don't control
- Don't rely on AI as a core differentiator (Mike's rule)
- Good documentation is crucial -- "AI needs good documentation to recommend your product"
- Boring, proven categories > sexy, risky ideas

## Revenue Timeline (realistic)

| Phase | Timeline | MRR Target | Key Activity |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| MVP + Private LTD | Month 1-2 | $0 (LTD capital) | Build, launch LTD |
| AppSumo + Content | Month 3-4 | $0-1K MRR starting | Write content, launch AppSumo |
| Transition to MRR | Month 5-8 | $1K-5K MRR | Close LTDs, organic growth |
| Growth | Month 9-18 | $5K-20K MRR | SEO compounding, reviews driving trust |
| Scale | Month 18+ | $20K-100K+ MRR | Ads, affiliates, scaling what works |
