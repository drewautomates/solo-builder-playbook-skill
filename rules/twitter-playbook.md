# Twitter/X Building in Public Playbook

**Sources**: Rob Hallam (SuperX, 0 to $13K MRR in 4 months, 0 to 34K followers in 1 year), Tibo ($700K/month combined, support routed to DMs)

## Why Twitter/X

- Direct line of communication with potential customers
- Building in public creates accountability and audience simultaneously
- Customer support via DMs builds deep relationships
- Free distribution that compounds with consistency

## Setup

1. **Profile photo**: Real face (builds trust)
2. **Bio**: One sentence explaining what you're building and for whom
3. **Pinned post**: Your goal + elevator pitch for your product

## The Content Loop (Rob's Framework)

Rotate between three types of content:

### 1. Entertaining (viral potential)
- Hot takes, memes, relatable struggles
- Gets reach, grows followers
- "The thing that gets people in the door"

### 2. Educational (sell without selling)
- Tutorials, tips, how-I-did-it threads
- Demonstrates expertise
- Soft sells your product through teaching

### 3. Inspirational (social proof)
- Share revenue milestones, user wins, metrics
- Screenshots of Stripe dashboard, user testimonials
- "Here's what happened this month"

**Repeat this cycle continuously.**

## Building in Public System

1. **Pick one specific goal** and document daily progress
2. Share wins AND failures transparently
3. Revenue screenshots, user counts, feature launches
4. Ask your audience for input on features ("Should I build X or Y?")
5. People root for you when they watch you build

### Rob's Results
- 0 to 34,000 followers in one year
- 100,000+ impressions per day
- $1,000 MRR added in first 24 hours of product launch
- Growing 25% month over month

## The DM Support Hack (Tibo's Secret Weapon)

> "Until each product is making $10K per month in revenue, the support link on each software is directing people to my Twitter DMs."
> -- Tibo, $700K/month

Why this works:
- Creates insane reactivity (fix a bug in 5 minutes, they're a customer for life)
- Users feel closer to you personally
- Generates a daily flow of feedback
- When you ship a feature someone asked for in an hour, "it creates this insane feeling for the guy. He's going to talk about that. He's going to become the first advocate for your product."

## What the Platform Rewards (2025-2026)

- **Video gets 10x reach** compared to text posts (Rob's observation)
- Quick screen recordings of your product
- Behind-the-scenes of your building process
- Reply to your own tweets with updates (creates threads)

## Systemizing Content

1. Analyze top-performing posts in your niche
2. Identify the CONCEPT behind why it worked (not the exact words)
3. Recreate the concept in your own style with your own examples
4. Double down on content types that perform, kill what doesn't

> "Even if it went viral, if it doesn't drive the right audience or conversions, kill it."
> -- Rob

## Building Connections

- Quality replies on other people's posts (not AI-generated generic comments)
- Engage with other builders in your niche
- Retweet with genuine commentary
- The network compounds over time -- mutual support, shoutouts, collaborations

## Timeline Expectations

- Month 1: Set up profile, post daily, find your voice
- Month 2-3: 1K-5K followers if consistent
- Month 3-4: Launch product to your audience
- Month 4-6: $5K-$10K MRR if product is solid
- Year 1: 10K-30K followers, established personal brand
