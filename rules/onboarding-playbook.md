## Why Onboarding Matters More Than Features

> "Focus 90% on onboarding. Most users only ever see it."
> -- Connor, $20K MRR

If your onboarding doesn't convert, it doesn't matter how good the product behind it is. Users never see it.

## The Formula (George)

### 1. Educate
Tell the user what the app does and why it matters. Set expectations.

### 2. Personalize
Ask guiding questions that:
- Set up the app for their specific needs
- Guide them to understanding WHY they need the app
- Create investment in the experience

### 3. Create FOMO
Show what they're missing without the app. Make them feel the gap.

### 4. Show the Gotcha Moment
Let them experience the core value... but gate the results behind the paywall.

> "Having them do the gotcha moment but not giving the results before the paywall."
> -- George

## The Sunk Cost Effect

> "The length of the onboarding process also contributes to how many people convert. Although it does add friction, it also makes the people who go through it have the sunken cost fallacy which causes users to at least get the free trial."
> -- George

Longer onboarding = more investment = higher trial conversion. But only if each step adds value or curiosity.

## Onboarding Design Process (Connor)

1. Download 20+ apps in your niche
2. Screenshot EVERY onboarding screen
3. Put all screenshots in Figma
4. Identify patterns in high-converting apps
5. Pick the best elements and adapt to your app

**Study these high-converting apps**: Opal, Cali, Headspace, Duolingo

### Connor's onboarding principles:
- Invoke emotion (make them feel something)
- Show incentives (what they'll get)
- Personalize the experience
- Add charts/graphs for credibility
- Build urgency

## The Review Request Trick (Louis)

Place the app store review request DURING onboarding, before the paywall:
1. User goes through personalization questions
2. User is excited about seeing results
3. Ask for review at this peak emotional moment
4. Users typically leave 5-star reviews
5. Then show the paywall

Result: High app store rating → better App Store ranking → more organic downloads → compound growth.

## Trial Strategy

### Attach trial to annual plan (George)
- Free trial starts on the yearly plan ($59.99/year)
- Users who convert have higher LTV than monthly
- Monthly option exists but isn't the default

### Hard paywall vs. trial
- **Trial**: Lower barrier, captures more users, but some churn after trial ends
- **Hard paywall**: Higher commitment, lower volume, but users who pay are more engaged
- Mobile apps: Trial usually wins (users expect to try before buying)
- SaaS: Either works depending on price point

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| Onboarding completion rate | Is the flow too long or confusing? |
| Trial start rate | Is the value proposition clear? |
| Trial-to-paid conversion | Is the product delivering on the promise? |
| Time in onboarding | Are users engaged or rushing through? |
| Drop-off step | Which specific step loses users? |

If trial start rate is high but trial-to-paid is low → product problem (see `pivot-playbook.md`).
