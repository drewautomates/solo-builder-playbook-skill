# SEO & Content Playbook

**Sources**: Mike ($200K MRR), Tibo ($700K/month), Bhanu (SiteGPT, $13K MRR with zero paid marketing)

## Core Principle

> "It is never, ever, ever, ever too early to start writing content."
> -- Mike, $200K MRR

Content compounds. The earlier you publish, the longer Google, ChatGPT, and AI search tools index it. Start on day one.

## Strategy 1: Competitor Comparison Pages (Mike)

Write these pages immediately:
- "[Your Product] vs [Competitor]"
- "Best [Competitor] alternatives in 2026"
- "[Competitor] alternative for [specific use case]"

These capture high-intent search traffic -- people actively looking for solutions.

## Strategy 2: Engineering as Marketing (Bhanu)

Build free tools that rank on Google and funnel users to your main product.

**Bhanu's process**:
1. Go to Ahrefs Keywords Explorer with blank search
2. Add keyword filters relevant to your space (e.g., "AI" + "generator")
3. Filter keyword difficulty: KD < 10 (easy to rank)
4. Filter volume: minimum 1,000 monthly searches
5. List keywords in Notion: volume, difficulty, relevance to your product
6. Design CTA for each free tool that connects to your main product
7. Prioritize: high volume + low KD + easy to build + highly relevant
8. Build each tool in ~5 minutes with Cursor

**Result**: 50+ free tools driving 50,000 monthly clicks from Google. 90% of Google traffic comes from free tools. $13K MRR with zero paid marketing.

## Strategy 3: Become a Media Company (Tibo)

At a certain point, your company needs a content engine:
- Testimonials and case studies from successful users
- Industry takes and thought leadership
- Educational content about your problem space
- "Content that fuels everything else you do"

> "At one point, a company needs to become a media company."
> -- Tibo

## Strategy 4: AI-Optimized Documentation (Mike)

> "Good documentation especially today is going to be the key to success because AI needs good documentation to recommend your product well."
> -- Mike

Write clear, comprehensive docs. AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) increasingly recommend products they can find good documentation for.

## Strategy 5: Open Source Content (Nevo)

For developer-facing products:
- Write articles on Dev.to, Medium, Hackernoon
- "Top 10 open source [X]" listicles (targets Google Discover feed)
- Submit to Hacker News as "Show HN"
- Post on r/selfhosted, r/webdev, r/programming

Nevo's result: 5M+ downloads, $17K MRR from organic/content channels.

## Content Prioritization

| Content Type | SEO Value | Conversion Value | Effort |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Competitor comparison pages | High | Very High | Low |
| "Alternative to" pages | High | Very High | Low |
| Free tools | Very High | High | Medium |
| Blog posts / tutorials | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Case studies | Low | Very High | High |
| Documentation | Medium | High | High |

**Start with comparison and alternative pages. They take 1-2 hours each and capture buyers.**

## Timeline

- Month 1: Write 5-10 competitor comparison pages
- Month 2-3: Build 3-5 free tools targeting low-KD keywords
- Month 3-6: Weekly blog posts, case studies from users
- Month 6+: Content compounds -- traffic grows without additional effort
- Month 12+: SEO becomes largest acquisition channel (this is Mike's and Tibo's experience)
