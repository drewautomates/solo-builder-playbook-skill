# Open Source as Distribution

**Source**: Nevo (Postiz, $17K MRR, 5M+ Docker downloads, ~80% profit margins)

## When This Works

- Developer-facing products
- Tools that can be self-hosted
- You want brand credibility in the dev community
- You're comfortable with open source licensing

## The Launch Week (Execute All in Same Week)

### 1. Prepare the GitHub Repo
- Treat it as your landing page
- Write "open-source alternative to [X]" for instant context
- Choose license: MIT (most permissive), Apache 2, or AGPL3 (protects against competitors)
- Create issues for potential contributors
- Write deployment docs with Docker
- Open a Discord server for community

### 2. Write Content
- Articles on Dev.to, Medium, Hackernoon
- "Top 10 open source [X] projects" listicles
- These target Google Discover feed for viral reach

### 3. Hacker News
- Submit as "Show HN: [project name]"
- Link to GitHub (NOT your main website)
- Expected: ~10K views from a Show HN post

### 4. Reddit
- Post on r/selfhosted (self-promotion is explicitly welcome for open source)
- Also: r/webdev, r/programming, r/LocalLLaMA (if AI-related)
- Repost with each new version (monthly)

### 5. Lemmy
- Self-hosted Reddit alternative
- Gets 100+ upvotes consistently for open source projects
- Smaller but very engaged audience

### 6. Cross-Promote
- X/Twitter, LinkedIn, newsletter
- All pointing to GitHub
- Execute all 5 steps in the same week to hit GitHub Trending
