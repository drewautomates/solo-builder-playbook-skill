# Partnership Distribution Playbook

**Source**: Hassam (LaunchFast, $0 to $25K MRR in 90 days with zero audience)

## When to Use This

- You have zero audience and zero distribution
- You can clearly identify WHO has your target customers
- You're willing to trade equity for speed
- You have domain knowledge but no reach

> "50% of something is better than 100% of nothing."
> -- Hassam

## Step 1: Identify Distribution Partners

Who already has your target audience?
- Coaching companies
- Course creators
- Communities (Discord, Slack, forums)
- Influencers with engaged followings
- Complementary SaaS products

List 5 potential partners this week.

## Step 2: Build the Demo (48 hours)

Don't pitch an idea. Pitch a working demo.

Hassam's approach:
1. "Give me 48 hours. If you like what you see, we partner. No strings attached. You have nothing to lose."
2. Build a functional MVP in that 48-hour window
3. Record a video demo
4. Send it over

## Step 3: Structure the Deal

- Equity split based on what they bring (audience, brand, ongoing support)
- Hassam gave up equity for instant access to thousands of Amazon sellers
- The coaching company got a tool to offer their students
- Win-win: they get product, you get distribution

> "Instead of me sacrificing resources that can be more valuable than equity, such as my time, I would trade equity any day to get access to someone else's distribution."
> -- Hassam

## Step 4: Launch + Iterate

Once the deal is done:
- Ship daily for the first 30 days
- Iterate based on real user feedback
- "Commit to shipping at least one improvement every day for the next 30 days"
- The partner's audience gives you instant validation AND revenue

## Hassam's Timeline

- Day 0: Pitched to Legacy X coaching company
- 48 hours: Built MVP with Cursor, sent demo
- Next day: "Quit your job. We're doing this full-time."
- Day 30: $10K MRR
- Day 60: $17-18K MRR
- Day 90: $21.8K MRR

## Key Principle

This playbook is specifically for your FIRST product. Once you have revenue, audience, and skills:
- Build your own distribution for future products
- Use partnerships to accelerate, not as a crutch
- But for product #1? Trading equity for instant customers is a great deal.
