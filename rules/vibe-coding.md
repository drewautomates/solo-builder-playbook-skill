# Vibe Coding: Building Apps Without a CS Degree

**Sources**: Hassam ($25K MRR, Cursor, 48 hours), Sam ($14K MRR, ChatGPT → Cursor), Connor ($20K MRR, Claude Code, 14 days), George ($17K MRR, Rork), David ($12K MRR, AI tools)

## The Evidence

5 of 19 successful founders had zero or minimal coding background. They built production apps with AI coding tools that generate real revenue.

> "I literally don't know how to code at all. I truly believe that anyone can build a mobile app these days."
> -- George, 18yo college freshman, $17K MRR

> "AI tools have really closed the gap between idea and execution."
> -- Hassam, $25K MRR in 90 days

## The Default Stack (2025-2026)

| Layer | Tool | Cost | Why |
|-------|------|------|-----|
| AI Coding | Cursor ($20-200/mo) or Claude Code ($200/mo) | $20-200/mo | Most AI-friendly coding tools |
| Frontend | Next.js + TypeScript | Free | Most supported by AI, huge community |
| Backend/DB | Supabase | $0-30/mo | Auth, database, storage in one |
| Hosting | Vercel | $0-20/mo | Deploy directly from code editor |
| Payments | Stripe (web) or RevenueCat (mobile) | Transaction fees | Industry standard |
| Email | Resend | $0-20/mo | Developer-friendly |
| AI Inference | OpenAI or Anthropic API | $40-100/mo | For AI features in your app |
| Mobile (optional) | Rork or Expo | $25-30/mo | Cross-platform mobile apps |

**Total infrastructure**: ~$100-400/month to run a $10K+ MRR business.

## Hassam's 48-Hour Sprint

How he built LaunchFast (Amazon research tool) from nothing to demo:

| Hours | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| 1-4 | Map existing systems, SOPs, workflows of target users |
| 5-12 | Build core features with Cursor (functional, not perfect) |
| 13-20 | Test, fix bugs, iterate with Cursor |
| 21-30 | Polish UI and branding ("branding is everything") |
| 31-40 | Edge case testing, ensuring stability |
| 41-48 | Final polish, prep demo, record video |

**Result**: Sent demo to a coaching company with existing audience. Next day: "Quit your job. We're doing this full-time." $25K MRR within 90 days.

## Sam's Learning Path

Evolution of a non-technical founder:

1. **Started**: Described idea to ChatGPT voice mode, got code
2. **First tool**: Copy-pasted code into Notepad (yes, Notepad)
3. **Upgrade 1**: Discovered VS Code, still copy-pasting from ChatGPT
4. **Upgrade 2**: Friend told him about Cursor ("raw dogging it in VS Code is dumb when Cursor exists")
5. **First MVP**: Built in one week with Cursor, deployed on Heroku
6. **First user**: Got an "application error" screen... but still used the core features
7. **Result**: $14K MRR, 10,000 users in 6 months

> "As long as what you're trying to solve works, I think you can ship anything."
> -- Sam, on shipping a broken MVP

## Key Principles

### 1. Domain knowledge > coding skill
Every vibe coder who succeeded had deep understanding of their target user's pain. The code was the easy part.

### 2. Ship broken, fix fast
Sam's first user got an error screen. George's API went down at launch. Both recovered and thrived. Shipping > perfection.

### 3. Know when to hire
George: "The greatest ROI was hiring my developer from Pakistan for $250 on Fiverr" (for payments and auth integration). Vibe code the 80%, hire for the 20% you can't figure out.

### 4. Use AI as your advisor
> "Anytime there was an issue with Expo, I would just copy the logs, throw the logs into ChatGPT. I had ChatGPT as my adviser."
> -- George

### 5. Expand past vibe coding at $5K MRR
> "Vibe coding is great to release quickly and validate ideas, but once you start moving past $5K a month, you should start investing in product quality."
> -- George

## Common Vibe Coding Mistakes

- Spending months "learning to code" before building (just start prompting)
- Not using the right tool (Cursor > VS Code for AI-assisted coding)
- Over-engineering the MVP (functional > perfect)
- Not hiring for things outside your ability (payments, auth, complex integrations)
- Building features nobody asked for (talk to users first)

## Timeline: Zero to Revenue

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Choose idea based on domain knowledge, start prompting in Cursor/Claude Code |
| 2 | Core functionality working, deployed somewhere (even if buggy) |
| 3 | First users testing, collecting feedback daily |
| 4 | Iterating based on feedback, fixing critical bugs |
| 5-6 | Launch publicly, start distribution (see distribution playbooks) |
| 8-12 | If traction exists, $1K-5K MRR |
