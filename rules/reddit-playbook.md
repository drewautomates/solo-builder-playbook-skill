# Reddit Marketing Playbook

**Source**: Roman, co-founder of Goji Berry AI
**Result**: $0 to $34K MRR in 6 months. 11 million impressions. 40,000+ website visitors.

## Why Reddit

- Free distribution with massive reach
- Real feedback from real people (brutal honesty = fast learning)
- Best for: B2B SaaS, productivity tools, dev tools, anything with a story to tell
- Not for: Getting to $100K MRR (Reddit is for your first 10-1,000 customers)

> "Reddit is amazing for getting your first 10 customers, your first 100 customers. Probably not your first thousand customers, but that's what Reddit is for."
> -- Pat Walls, Starter Story

## Setup (Week 1-2)

### Account Creation
1. Create fresh Reddit account -- **NOT with a new email** (new email + new Reddit = instant ban)
2. One account per browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) -- max 3 accounts
3. Add profile picture
4. Link your SaaS in bio
5. **Activate "hide my feed" feature** -- prevents people from seeing you only post about one topic

### Warm-Up Period (7-14 days)
- Only comment and upvote. Zero marketing.
- Build karma in your target subreddits
- The more karma you have, the stronger your account

## Posting Strategy (Week 3+)

### Content Ideas (You Already Have Stories)

Turn ANY event into a Reddit post:
- Got rejected from YC? Post about it (Roman got 179K views from this)
- Hit a revenue milestone? Share with proof
- Paid influencers and it flopped? Write about what you learned
- Tried a new marketing channel? Share results with screenshots

> "You can turn any event happening in your life into a Reddit post."
> -- Roman

### The Anatomy of a Viral Reddit Post

1. **Tell a story** -- not a product pitch
2. **Show proof** -- screenshots of dashboards, revenue, metrics. Nobody argues with real data.
3. **Never put your SaaS directly in the post** -- trigger curiosity instead
4. **Include specific numbers** -- "$1,250 spent on influencers, here's what happened"

**Roman's most viral post**: "I paid five influencers on LinkedIn to promote my SaaS. Here's what $1,250 got me."
- 160K views, 543 upvotes
- ~2,000 visitors
- ~10-15 paying customers from ONE post

### Writing Process
1. Tell your story to ChatGPT via voice mode (especially if non-native English)
2. Ask ChatGPT to clean up and structure the post
3. Review and add personal voice back in

## Distribution Mechanics

### The First 10 Minutes Are Everything
- You need 10+ upvotes in the first 5-10 minutes
- Build a group of 10-15 friendly marketers/founders
- Share each other's Reddit posts, everyone upvotes and comments
- This initial boost gets the algorithm to push your post higher

### Engagement
- **Reply to absolutely every comment** -- shows engagement, boosts ranking
- Change the angle with every post -- redirect to YouTube, Twitter, different story formats
- Engage authentically, not like a marketer

## Target Subreddits

For SaaS/apps:
- r/SaaS
- r/indiehackers
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong
- r/startups
- r/smallbusiness
- r/Entrepreneur

For specific niches, find relevant communities using Reddit search.

For open source: r/selfhosted (self-promotion is explicitly welcome)

## Handling Negativity

You WILL get negative comments. Here's how to handle them:

1. **Show proof** -- nobody argues with real screenshots
2. **Block insulting/toxic commenters** -- don't engage
3. **Persist through it** -- Pat Walls faced a petition to ban Starter Story from Reddit. It didn't matter at all in hindsight.

> "None of it matters. Just block these people, continue building your app, sharing your story and everything will work out."
> -- Pat Walls, Starter Story

## Common Mistakes

- Posting a product link with no story (instant downvotes)
- Using a brand new email for a new Reddit account (instant ban)
- Not warming up the account first (posts get shadowbanned)
- Posting the same format repeatedly (change angles)
- Getting discouraged by negative comments (it's part of the game)

## Timeline Expectations

- Week 1-2: Account warmup, zero marketing
- Week 3-4: First posts, learning what resonates
- Month 2-3: Finding your rhythm, 2-3 posts/week
- Month 3-6: Compounding -- posts drive traffic, traffic drives signups
- Expected result: 100-1,000 paying customers in 6 months
